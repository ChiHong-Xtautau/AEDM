# AEDM

This is the code for the model stealing algorithm proposed by our ICONIP2024 paper "Chi Hong, Jiyue Huang, Lydia Chen, Robert Birke, Adversarial Knowledge Extraction via Steering Diffusion Models".

This project relies on https://github.com/lucidrains/denoising-diffusion-pytorch/tree/main. To facilitating users, we provide a copy in this repo.

To run the algorithm, please extract the pretrained diffusion model. You may replace the pretrained models by yours.
